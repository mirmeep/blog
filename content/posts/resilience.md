### Before the Diagnoses

*If you don’t attend college, you’ll fail in life!*

Throughout my years at a private college prepatory high school, I was taught that college was the only path to a successful life. Success, it seemed, could only be achieved with a degree. Anything less was failure. This belief was drilled into us, and I carried that weight when I entered college. Even as I faced severe health struggles and social isolation, I believed that pushing through and graduating as quickly as possible was the only way to meet society's expectations of success.

By the time I graduated, I was 21 years old, had finished my degree in computer science, and had a 4.0 GPA. Yes, I entered college at the expected age of 18, right after high school, and no, I didn’t partake in an accelerated program. I was driven, but not for the reasons you think.

My body was falling apart, but I kept going. It wasn’t just that I was exhausted; I was fighting against the debilitating effects of my own body.

Heart palpitations. 
Chronic pain. 
Weak limbs. 
Dizziness. 
Brain fog. 
Fatigue. 

It felt like every step I took in my academic journey was heavier than the last.

Despite walking 3 hours a day and going to bed at 9pm every night, I could not sleep for more than 4 hours. I'd suddenly wake up confused, heart palpitating, tremors, cold sweats, and adrenaline coursing through my veins.

I tried to ignore it all, telling myself that if I did, I could keep going and move toward that finish line. Because to finish was to get college out of the way. To finish was to be out of that toxic environment. To finish was to give in to my body.

I wanted out of the exhausting cycle of survival. 

Normal people might take a leave of absence, but for me, that wasn't an option. I couldn’t afford to fall behind—society’s definition of success meant finishing college without pause, and I was determined to do just that, no matter the cost. The message from my high school was clear:

*If you don’t attend college, you’ll fail in life!*

I had to keep going. There was no other choice.

### Post-Graduation

I had done everything right. Earned my degree. Yet, as I walked across that stage, something was missing. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being utterly alone. No one was there to celebrate with me, and the world outside my bubble of academia was not kind. It was as though my success meant nothing in the face of my invisible struggles.

After graduation, everything seemed to fall apart. I was bedridden for months, physically and emotionally drained. The crushing feeling of failure didn’t go away, no matter how many degrees or accolades I had to my name. I had followed the prescribed path—graduating early, excelling in my studies, sacrificing my health—and still, I felt like I had nothing to show for it. The hardest part was realizing I wasn’t the success story I had been led to believe I should be.

### After the Diagnoses

It wasn’t until two years after graduation that I finally received a diagnosis. Those years were a blur of confusion, pain, and rejection—both from others and from my own body. If only I had known sooner, maybe I wouldn’t have felt so lost. But the truth was, I was already living in survival mode, and by then, the damage had been done.
