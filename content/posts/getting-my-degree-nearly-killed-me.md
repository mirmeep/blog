I like to believe that this title is an overexxageration regarding my 3 years in college. 

It is not.

I sincerely believe that I nearly died.

### Forced Sleep Deprivation

Sleep deprivation isn't fun.

There are many out there who *choose* not to sleep. Whether it's by scrolling through their phones or binging a suspenseful show on Netflix. Maybe they're texting a friend over which celebrity cheated on who. Perhaps they, in fact, do not choose whether to engage in these dopamine driven activities when they should sleep.

Regardless, I am not one of those people.

Following a strict schedule, I'd be in bed by 9pm. It didn't matter if it were during the week or weekend, if I wasn't in bed by 9, all hell would break loose.

Something I'd realize years later, the time in which I got to bed didn't matter.

The truth was I struggled to fall asleep.

It didn't matter if I hiked for 3 hours that day, if I sat in traffic for an hour and a half, or if I had 6 hours of classes followed by 4 hours of homework.

My body was constantly on fire.

Forgetting the fatigue of the day, my body went on high alert mode as soon as I laid down. The flames began in my chest, slowly blossoming out, filling every vein and artery in my body, eventually reaching the tips of my fingers and toes. I wanted to shift, to toss and turn, to scream, to cry, but the only thing I knew to gaurantee sleep would be to keep as still as possible. 

It would take 4 hours later for the inferno to die. This is when I'd fall asleep, only to be woken 2 hours later with another wave. 

### High Expectations

Why didn't I drop out when most people would, given these circumstances?

Lethargically attending class each day, I knew what I had to do: finish my degree as soon as possible. Finish so I'd be out of this clockwork hell. Finish so I can get this degree out of the way and I wouldn't be seen as a failure. Because if I had stopped, would I have ever finished a degree?

I pretended nothing was wrong. It was the only way to keep going, even when it felt like I was about to drop dead. Even on the days when I *wanted* to drop dead.


### Lessons Learned

Nothing had mattered, after all.
